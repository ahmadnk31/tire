        "q2": {
          "question": "How often should I replace my tires?",
          "answer": "Tires typically need replacement every 6-10 years depending on usage, but you should check them regularly for signs of wear. The legal tread depth minimum is 1.6mm, but we recommend replacement when tread depth reaches 3mm for safety reasons."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "What's the difference between summer, winter, and all-season tires?",
          "answer": "Summer tires perform best in warm conditions, providing excellent grip and handling. Winter tires are designed for cold temperatures and snow, with special compounds that remain flexible in freezing conditions. All-season tires offer a compromise, performing adequately in most conditions but not excelling in extreme weather."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "Do you sell used or refurbished tires?",

          "question": "What is included in a wheel alignment service?",

        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "How often should I rotate my tires?",
          "answer": "We recommend rotating your tires every 10,000 to 12,000 kilometers or according to your vehicle manufacturer's recommendations. Regular rotation ensures even wear and extends tire life."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "Can you repair a flat tire, or do I need a replacement?",
          "answer": "Whether a tire can be repaired depends on the type and extent of damage. Punctures in the tread area that are smaller than 6mm can typically be repaired. However, sidewall damage, large punctures, or blowouts usually require tire replacement for safety reasons."
        },
        "q4": {
          "question": "How long does a typical tire installation take?",

          "question": "Do I need my original receipt for warranty claims?",
          "answer": "While having your original receipt is ideal, we can also look up your purchase in our system if you bought your tires from us. For manufacturer warranties, we may be able to process claims based on the DOT code on the tire even without a receipt."

        "q4": {
          "question": "Can I transfer my tire warranty if I sell my vehicle?",
          "answer": "Most manufacturer warranties stay with the tire, not the owner, so they can typically be transferred. However, some extended warranties and road hazard protections may not be transferable. Check your specific warranty terms or contact us for details."

        "q5": {
          "question": "What's the difference between a defect and normal wear?",
          "answer": "Defects typically appear as unusual patterns, bulges, separations, or premature wear that doesn't match driving habits. Normal wear occurs gradually and evenly across the tread surface. Our technicians are trained to identify the difference between defects and normal wear patterns."
